<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>
<div class="highlight">
<p>
    In Elixir the equal sign <code><span class="o">=</span></code> doesn't denote assignment, it denotes a pattern matching
    operation. A pattern match looks like this:
</p>
<p><code>pattern <span class="o">=</span> expression</code></p>
<p>
    First the right hand side is evaluated and its value is matched against the pattern on the left
    hand side. The pattern match succeeds if the expression is compatible with the pattern, it fails
    otherwise. Let's look at a few examples:
</p>
<p>The following pattern match will succeed and bind the variable <code>a</code> to <code><span class="m">2</span></code> .</p>
<p><code>{<span class="m">1</span>, a} <span class="o">=</span> {<span class="m">1</span>, <span class="m">2</span>}</code></p>
<p>On the contrary, the following pattern match will fail because the tuples have different sizes.</p>
<p><code>{a, b, c} <span class="o">=</span> {<span class="m">1</span>, <span class="m">2</span>}</code></p>
<p>
    Elixir lets you rebind variables, so it's actually possibly to do things like <code>n <span class="o">=</span> n <span class="o">+</span> <span class="m">1</span></code>,
    if you want to match against the value of a variable use the <code><span class="o">^</span></code> operator.
</p>
<p>This will work:</p>
<p><code>x <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">1</span></code></p>
<p><code>^x <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">1</span></code></p>
<p>This will fail:</p>
<p><code>^x <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">2</span></code></p>
<p>When you're ready to jump to the next step on the tutorial type <code><span class="ss">:ok</span></code> .</p>
