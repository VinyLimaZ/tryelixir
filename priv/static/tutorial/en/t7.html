<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>
    Variables are used to store values. In Elixir variables start with a lower case letter or an
    underscore. Variables that start with an underscore are useful when we need a variable but
    its value can be ignored.
</p>
<p>Try to write the following:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><code>age <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">25</span></code></p>
</div>
<p>We can check the value of a variable simply by typing its name:</p>
<p><code>age</code></p>
