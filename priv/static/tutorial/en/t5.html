<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>
    Lists in Elixir are delimited by square brackets and their elements are separated by commas.
    Element of a list can be of different types.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><code>[<span class="m">1</span>, <span class="m">2</span>, <span class="m">3</span>]</code></p>
<p><code>[<span class="m">1</span>, <span class="ss">:two</span>, [<span class="m">3</span>, <span class="m">4</span>]]</code></p>
<p>To access the head and tail of a list we use pattern matching and the <code><span class="o">|</span></code> operator:</p>
<p><code>[head <span class="o">|</span> tail] = [<span class="m">1</span>,<span class="m">2</span>,<span class="m">3</span>]</code></p>
<p>Try to type <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> .</p>
<p>When you're ready to jump to the next step on the tutorial type <code><span class="ss">:ok</span></code> .</p>
</div>
