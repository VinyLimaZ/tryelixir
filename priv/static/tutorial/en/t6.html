<h3>Strings and char lists</h3>
<p>
    In Elixir double-quoted strings are not the same as single-quoted strings. Double-quoted strings are
    represented as binaries, a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 encodings. Single-quoted strings are represented
    as a list of integers, because of this we refer to them as char lists.
</p>
<p>To confirm what I've just said, try the following:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p><code>is_binary <span class="s2">"hello"</span></code></p>
<p><code>is_list <span class="s1">'hello'</span></code></p>
<p><code><span class="s2">"hello"</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'hello'</span></code></p>
<p>
    Strings are all encoded in UTF-8, you can type <code><span class="s2">"héllò"</span></code> and see for yourself.
</p>
<p>
    We can get the ASCII integer of a letter with the <code><span class="o">?</span></code> operator, <code><span class="sx">?a</span></code> will return
    <code><span class="m">97</span></code> .
</p>
<p>This means we can also write:</p>
<p><code>[<span class="sx">?a</span>, <span class="sx">?b</span>, <span class="sx">?c</span>]</code></p>
<p>
    Elixir detects that all characters in the list are printable and returns the quoted representation. Adding
    a non-printable character will print a normal list. Try to write <code>[<span class="sx">?a</span>, <span class="sx">?b</span>, <span class="sx">?c</span>, <span class="m">1</span>]</code> .
</p>
</div>
