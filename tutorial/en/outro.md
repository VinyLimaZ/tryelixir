#The end

You're done!

Now that you've gotten a feel for the syntax of Elixir maybe you should read a book on it to improve your skills? Here are a couple of good ones, [Programming Elixir (Pragmatic Programmers)](http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) and [Introducing Elixir (O'Reilly)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do).

If you'd like a more pragmatic approach rather than reading a book you could take a look at the official [Getting Started Guide](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html). However, if you come from the Erlang world maybe the [Crash Course for Erlang developers](http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html) would better suit you.

You should also hop on #elixir-lang @ irc.freenode.net if you have any questions!
