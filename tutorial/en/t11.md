#Compiling modules

If you have a working installation of Elixir you can compile your modules with the `elixirc` command. Try to save our simple `Math` module from the previous step as `math.ex` and do the following in your terminal:

`$ elixirc math.ex`

A file named `Elixir.Math.beam` is generated, now if you start `iex` in the same directory, our module will be available.

When you're ready to jump to the next step in the tutorial type `:ok`.
