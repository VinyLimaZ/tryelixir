#Modules

It's possible to group several functions into a module, all we have to do is call the `defmodule` function and use `def` to define our functions.

```
defmodule Math do
  def sum(a, b) do
    a + b
  end

  def square(x) do
    x * x
  end
end
```

Now try to invoke `Math.sum(3, 6)` and `Math.square(3)`.

Inside a module we can define named functions with `def` and private functions with `defp`. A named function is available to be invoked from other modules, a private function can only be invoked locally.

```
defmodule PrivateMath do
  def sum(a, b) do
    do_sum(a, b)
  end

  defp do_sum(a, b) do
    a + b
  end
end
```

Try to call `PrivateMath.sum(1, 2)`. As expected the result is `3`.

Now try `PrivateMath.do_sum(1, 2)`.

We get `** (UndefinedFunctionError) undefined function: PrivateMath.do_sum/2`, this is because `do_sum/2` is a private function and can only be called inside the `PrivateMath` module.

When you're ready to jump to the next step on the tutorial type `:ok`.
