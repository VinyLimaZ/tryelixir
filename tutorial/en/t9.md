#Functions

An anonymous function is created with the `fn` keyword:

`f = fn(x) -> x * 2 end`

To call the function we simply type `f.(3)`. Notice the dot on the function call, the dot is required on anonymous functions, it's not needed on named functions though:

`Enum.map([1, 2, 3], fn(x) -> x * 2 end)`

Parantheses around the arguments of a named function are optional:

`Enum.map [1, 2, 3], fn(x) -> x * 2 end`

In the above function call `Enum` indicates the name of the module, `map` is the function we want to call inside that module. The number of parameters in a function is referred as the arity of the function, and it's usual to refer to functions as `Enum.map/2`. This means that `Enum.map` has an arity of 2.

Anonymous functions also accept various clauses and guards:

```
g = fn
  x, y when x > 0 -> x + y
  x, y -> x * y
end
```

To test this try `g.(1, 3)` and `g.(-1, 3)`.
