#String and char lists

In Elixir double-quoted strings are not the same as single-quoted strings. Double-quoted strings are represented as binaries, a sequence of bytes in UTF-8 encodings. Single-quoted strings are represented as a list of integers, because of this we refer to them as char lists.

To confirm what I've just said, try the following:

`is_binary "hello"`

`is_list 'hello'`

`"hello" == 'hello'`

Strings are all encoded in UTF-8, you can type `"héllò"` and see for yourself.

We can get the ASCII integer of a letter with the `?` operator, `?a` will return `97`.

This means we can also write:

`[?a, ?b, ?c]`

Elixir detects that all characters in the list are printable and returns the quoted representation. Adding a non-printable character will print a normal list. Try to write `[?a, ?b, ?c, 1]`.
