#Pattern Matching

In Elixir the equal sign `=` doesn't denote assignment, it denotes a pattern matching operation. A pattern match looks like this:

`pattern = expression`

First the right hand side is evaluated and its value is matched against the pattern on the left hand side. The pattern match succeeds if the expression is compatible with the pattern, it fails otherwise. Let's look at a few examples:

The following pattern match will succeed and bind the variable `a` to `2`.

`{ 1, a } = { 1, 2 }`

On the contrary, the following pattern match will fail because the tuples have different sizes.

`{ a, b, c } = { 1, 2 }`

Elixir lets you rebind variables, so it's actually possibly to do things like `n = n + 1`, if you want to match against the value of a variable use the `^` operator.

This will work:

`x = 1`

`^x = 1`

This will fail:

`^x = 2`

When you're ready to jump on the next step of the tutorial type `:ok`.
