#Variables

Variables are used to store values. In Elixir variables start with a lower case letter or an underscore. Variables that start with an underscore are useful when we need a variable but its value can be ignored.

Try to write the following:

`age = 25`

We can check the value of a variable simply by typing its name:

`age`
