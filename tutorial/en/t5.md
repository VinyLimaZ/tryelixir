#Lists

Lists in Elixir are delimited by square brackets and their elements are separated by commas.

Elements of a list can be of different types.

`[1, 2, 3]`

`[1, :two, [3, 4]]`

To access the head and tai lof a list we use pattern matching and the `|` operator:
`[head | tail] = [1, 2, 3]`

Try to type `head` and `tail`.

When you're ready to jump to the next step on the tutorial type `:ok`.
