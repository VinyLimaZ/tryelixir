#Tuples

Tuples let you combine multiple items into a single data type, all you need to make a tuple is surround a group of items with curly braces:

`{ :radius, 20 }`

`{ :foo, :bar, 123  }`

To access a tuple use the built-in function `elem`. Try it yourself, `elem { 1, 2, 3 }, 0`.

In the same way, it's also possible to set the value of the nth element of a tuple by doing, `put_elem { :one, :two, :three }, 0, :four`.

Now try to use the `set_elem` function to go to the next step of the tutorial.
