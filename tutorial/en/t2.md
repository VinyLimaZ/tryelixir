#Basics

We've got back the number `12`.
In interactive mode we can type and Elixir expression and get the result straight away.

Addition is not the only operation we can do with numbers, there's also subtraction, multiplication and division. Try to type something like `20 - 6` or `6 * 3`. Floating point division is done with the `/` operator, for itneger divison use the function `div`.

Try typing `12 / 3` and `div 12, 3` to see the difference.
