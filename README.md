# Try Elixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tryelixir/tryelixir.png?branch=elixir-1.0)](https://travis-ci.org/tryelixir/tryelixir)

This is meant to be an introduction to Elixir, not a normal Elixir REPL.
Data is deleted after 5 minutes of idle and many Elixir modules are restricted for security reasons. Try Elixir concept and design is inspired by [Try Haskell](http://tryhaskell.org/) and [Try Clojure](http://tryclj.com/). It's written in JavaScript and Elixir with [dynamo](https://github.com/elixir-lang/dynamo) and Chris Done's [jquery-console](https://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console).

Disclaimer: Modules and functions are white-listed, but beware, random code might be able to run on your machine, be careful.
